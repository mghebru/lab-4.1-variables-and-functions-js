How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?

I approached creating more flexible functions by designing them to accept parameters instead of hard-coding values,
so the same function could handle different inputs and scenarios. I identified which parts of the logic were likely 
to need modification, such as prices, quantities, tax rates, or eligibility conditions, and used those as parameters.

What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?

A challenge I faced while incorporating conditional logic is making sure all possible case scanrios were checked for without writing 
overly complicated or redundant code.

How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?

Refactoring improves code readability and maintainbility by because it allows you to keep the functionality of the code while 
making improvements to or modifications to the code. When I refactor, I focus on using meaningful function and variable names,
and reducing duplicates so that changes only need to be made in one place.
